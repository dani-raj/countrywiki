## General info
CountryWiki is a catalogue of all countries. The app is built with Vue.js, using two open APIs. 
Users can search for a specific country and get its details, such as the number of people living there or the value of its currency. 
The app also includes a quiz game where people can test how well they can recognize the different flags of the world.

In this document I will go through the code to show and explain how the app works.

## Demo

## Technologies
